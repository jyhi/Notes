To make a presentation, you need several skills to make your presentation impressive to the audiences. Mr. Michelle gives us a presentation (not a lecture, as he said) about how to do this.

## 1. Voice Power

It's not being aloud the power, it's properly emphasizing people the power. By **pausing and stressing**, we can impress audiences well.

- Pausing and stress[^1]: *"No word was ever as effective as a rightly timed pause." -- Mark Twain*
    - Stress **nouns**, **adjectives**, ...
    - (Try) **to be different** every time (you give a different topic(?)).
    - Know your **key words**, the ones you should stress.
    - Different stress, different meaning.

## 2. Visual Aids

**LESS IS MORE**. Too much elements on the screen can make audiences distracted and lose attention to your presentation. It's the best to use only black and white.

- (Audiences) often read faster than you speak.
- **Don't use templates with diverse colors.**
- (Emphasize) not verbs, but **nouns**.
    - Strip out those useless. Try using 1 noun to summarize the topic.

## 3. Body Language

This includes **Gestures, Eye Contacts, Movements, Posture, and Facial Expressions**.

- *"People believe what they see, not what you say."*
- **Coordination** is the key.

## 4. Impact Techniques

Repeat on different levels.

- Repetition on **words**
- *"Bond, James Bond."* -- repetition of (?)**parts of phrases** (which are the key words)
- Repetition of **sounds**
    - _"Of cour**s**e, thi**s** i**s** a seriou**s** problem to which there i**s** no **s**imple **s**olution."_
    - Rhetorical[^2] questions
        - Turn statements into questions, and repead the key words.
    - Contracts
        - _"It's not **a matter of doing** things right.
            It's **a matter of doing** the right things."_
    - Groups of **three**
        - _"We must act together as a united people,
            **for** national reconciliation,
            **for** nation building,
            **for** the birth of a new world."_
