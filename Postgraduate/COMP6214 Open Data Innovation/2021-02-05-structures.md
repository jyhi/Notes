# Open, Closed, Hybrid, and Open Data

> Open Data means **anyone** can **freely access, use, modify, and share** for **any purpose** (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness).

- Closed data requires permissions in order to access, use, modify, and share.
- Hybrid data is a limited presentation (open) to the proprietary data (closed). (?)

**Linked Data** refers to a set of _best practices_ for publishing and interlinking structured data on the Web.

- Open data is a campaign
- Linked Data can be appled to open, closed, or hybrid data.
- _Best practices:_
  - URIs are used as names for things
  - HTTP URIs are used so that people can look up the names
  - RDF, SPARQL are used to query information
  - Other URIs are included for discovering more things

## Structures of Data

- Tabular
- Hierarchical
