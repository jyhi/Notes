# Physically Uncloneable Function (PUF)

PUFs exploit IC manufactoring process variations to generate a secret key. A set of challenges is then mapped to a set of responses (as fingerprints).

- Delay-based
- Silicon-based
- SRAM-based

## Quality Metrics

- **Uniqueless** is a measure of the ability of a device to generate unique ID
- **Reliability** is a measure of the ability of the PUF to generate a consistent response for the same challenge

## Response Generation

Refer to the slides.

## _Fuzzy_ Identification

I.e. accept some errors, as long as the response is not too far away (Hamming Distance) from the original one.

- PUF responses are not perfectly reproducible due to temporal noises
- It's hard to 100% recover the responses too
- Metrics measured:
  - **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**: the probability that the PUF is **implemented elsewhere**
  - **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**: the probability that the PUF generates an **invalid response**
  - **Equal Error Rate (EER)**: `max{FAR(t), FRR(t)}`
    - `t` is _threshold_
