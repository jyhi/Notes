# CMOS Technology, Design Principles, and Supply Chain Security

## What is Static CMOS?

- **Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor**, has:
  - a nMOS **pull-down network (PDN)** <-> 0 (GND)
  - a pMOS **pull-up network (PUN)** <-> 1 (Vdd)
  - one of the above is ON and another one is OFF

| | Pull-up OFF | Pull-up ON |
|-|-|-|
| Pull-down OFF | Z (float) | 1 |
| Pull-down ON | 0 | X (crossbar) |

## How to Construct Complex CMOS Functions

<!-- ? -->

## Propagation Delay Calculation

- Low-to-high: `t_{pLH} = 0.69 (R_p \cdot C_L)`
- High-to-low: `t_{pHL} = 0.69 (R_n \cdot C_L)`
- `t_p = (t_{pHL} + t_{pLH}) / 2`

## Power Consumption in CMOS Devices

- Dynamic power is consumed during switching
  - `P_{DYN} = 0.5 \cdot C \cdot f \cdot V_{dd}^2`
- Leakage power is consumed during idle state
  - `P_{LEAK} = I_{LEAK} \cdot V_{dd}`
