# Sensors

## Classification

- Passive: no additional energe is needed
- Active: requires external power
- Absolute: detects a stimulus in reference to an absolute physical scale that is independent of the measurement conditions
  - e.g.  (热敏电阻)
- Relative: produces a signal that relates to a sort of reference
  - e.g. thermocouple (热电耦)

## Static Characteristics

- Accuracy: how close the values are to the real values
- Precision: variance of values when repeatedly read (repeatability)
  - reproducibility: variance of values across sensors manufactured in one standard
- Resolution: the minimal change of input for a detectable change of output
- Errors: errors
  - systematic: can be corrected
  - random: noise
- I/O range: the minimum and the maximum value that can be measured
- Sensitivity: slope of the calibration curve
  - different sensitivity at different points

### Transfer Function

A function representing the input-output relation.

- Describes the system reponse of a sensor
- **Zero-order sensor** response instantaneously with full bandwidth

## Dynamic Characteristics

Response to the input is not perfectly reflected; _time-dependent._

- **First-order sensor**
  - e.g. a mercury therometer
- **Second-order sensor**
  - e.g. a spring-mass-dampen accelerometer
