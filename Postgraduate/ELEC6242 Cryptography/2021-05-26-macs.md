# Message Authentication Codes

## Hash Functions

A hash function maps an arbitrary length input to a short, fixed-length _digest_. Applications include:

- Message Authentication Codes (MACs)
- One-way password file
- Intrusion detection, virus detection, etc.

### Security Requirements

- **Pre-image**: `x` in `y = H(x)` (domain)
- _Collision_: `H(a) = H(b)`

A hash function must be:

1. Pre-image resistant
2. Collision resistant

## The Birthday Paradox

Consider `B` a set consisting independent identically distributed integers. Let `R` be a subset of `B`, and all `Ri` are selected randomly. Then, **when `n = 1.2 * B^{1/2}`, `Pr[exists i <> j: ri = rj] >= 1/2`**.

## Digital Signature

A digital signature on a message provides:

- Data origin authentication (of the signer)
- Non-repudiation

### Digital Signature Systems

DSS: `(G, S, V)`, where:

- `G() -> (pk, sk)`: a key generation algorithm
- `S(sk, m) -> t`: a signing algorithm
- `V(pk, m, t) -> {0, 1}`: a verification algorithm

#### The RSA Digital Signature Scheme

Key generation is the same as RSA encryption.

- Signing: `RSA(x, d) = x^d`
- Verification: `RSA(y, e) = y^e == x ? 1 : 0`
