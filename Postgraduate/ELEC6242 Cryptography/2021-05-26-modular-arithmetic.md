## Division in `Zn`

**Theorem:** `x` in `Zn` has an _inverse_ iff. `gcd(x, N) = 1`.

## Finding an Inverse of Element in `Zn`

1. Check if `x` has an inverse in `Zn` (`gcd(x, N) = 1`)
2. Find `a`, `b` such that `ax + bN = 1`
3. `a` is then the inverse of `x` in `Zn`

## Fermat's Little Theorem

Let `p` be a prime `x` in `Zp`, then `x^{p-1} = 1 : Zp`

e.g. `p = 5`, then `x^4 = 1 : Z5` (`x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4`)
