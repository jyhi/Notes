# RSA

## Trapdoor Function (TDF)

1. Construct `f` and `f^{-1}`
2. Given `x`, evaluation of `y = f(x)` is _trivial_
3. However, given only `y` and `f`, evaluation of `x = f^{-1}(y)` is _computationally nontrivial_
4. However, given `f^{-1}` and `y`, evaluation of `x = f^{-1}(y)` is _trivial_

## When Not to Use a TDF

**Never encrypt by applying `f` directory to the plaintext!**

## RSA as an TDF

Basic key generation algorithm:

1. Choose random _primes_ `p` and `q`
2. Let `N = pq`
3. Choose integers `e` and `d`, such that `ed = 1 (mod phi(N))`
4. Output `pk = (N, e)`, `sk = (p, q, d)`

e.g.

1. `p = 17`, `q = 11`
2. `N = 17 * 11 = 187`
3. `phi(N) = (p - 1)(q - 1) = 16 * 10 = 160`
  - `gcd(e, 160) = 1 -> e = 7`
  - `de = 1 -> 7d = 1 (mod 160) -> d = 23`
4. `pk = (187, 7)`, `sk = (17, 11, 23)`

## Encryption

    F(pk, x): Zn -> Zn : RSA(x, e) = x^e (mod n)

## Decryption

    F(sk, y): Zn -> Zn : RSA(y, d) = y^d (mod n)

## RSA Security

- `p` and `q` cannot be too close
- ...
