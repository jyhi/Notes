# Security

Aspects of security:

- Secrecy (confidentiality)
- Authentication (verifying identity)
- Nonrepodiation (signatures)
- Integrity (ensuring a genuine message)

## Cryptography

A basic building block for security.

### Fundamentals

- Messages must contain some **redundancy**
  - redundancy: preventing active intruders to send random junk as valid messages
- Some methods are needed to foil **replay attacks**

### The Encryption Model

- **Kerckhoff's Principle** (symmetric crypto): algorithms (E, D) are _public_
  - only the keys (K) are secret

### One-Time Pads

A simple scheme for perfect secrecy.

- XOR messages with pads to encrypt / decrypt
- **Pads are as long as the messages and cannot be reused!**
  - and thus, it's unbreakable

### Quantum Cryptography

### Cipher Modes

Cipher modes set how long messages are encrypted (at once).

- ECB (Electronic Code Book): vulnerable to shifts
- CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): has an IV (initialisation vector), insecure
- CFB (Cipher Feedback): similar to CBC, but byte-to-byte
- CTR (Counter): crypttext XOR counter
