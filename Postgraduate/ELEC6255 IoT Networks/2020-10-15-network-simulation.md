# Network Simulation

## Evaluation IoT Networks

### Why?

- Protocol development
- Pre-deployment design exploration

### Approaches

- Analytical methods
  - very high-level, general **mathematical model** of the network architecture and protocol
- Pratical implementation
  - deploy actual hardware and software into the real environment
- Network simulation
  - fixed step simulation: loop on time
  - discrete event simulation
