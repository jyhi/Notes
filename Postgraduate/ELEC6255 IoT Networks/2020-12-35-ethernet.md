# Ethernet

IEEE 802.3:

- Used for Local Area Networks (LANs)

## Frame Format

- Uses Manchester encoding
- IEEE 802.3 tweaks Ethernet (DIX)

| Preamble | SoF | Daddr | Saddr | Length / Types | Data | Pad | Checksum |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| `b1010101` | `1` | 6B | 6B | 2B | 0-1500B | 0-46B | 4B |

- Length / Types:
  - lengths \< `0x0600` (1536)
  - types \> `0x0600`
- Checksum: CRC32-Ethernet
- End of frame detection is left to PHY
- **Minimum frame size: 64B**
  - this ensures collisions can be detected

## Classic Ethernet

- Bus architecture: terminals "tapped into" a single coaxial cable
  - thus _ether_
- There is a maximum length; longer needs repeater

### CSMA-CD

_CSMA with Collision Detection_

- Listen to see if the channel is busy
- If not, transmit and listen for collision
  - if there's collision, stop immediately and try again after a period of time
- If yes, wait

Can be in either the states:

- contention
- transmission
- idle

### Exponential Back-off

Retries after a random time between 0 to an exponentially growing maximum time.

### Channel Utilisation

```
Utilisation = (Time in Transmission) / (Total Time)

(Time in Transmission) = (Frame [L]ength) / (Data [R]ate)
(Time in Contention) = (e * 2 * [D]istance) / [V]elocity
(Time in Idle) is ideally 0.

=> Efficiency = 1 / (1 + e2DR / LV)
```

## Switched Ethernet

Switches inspect frames and only forward frames to the destination port(s).

- **No need for CSMA-CD in _full-duplex mode_**
  - half-duplex links still need CSMA-CD to manage access between the _pair_ of stations
- Switches will need to buffer the frames when multiple stations send frames simultaneously
- Improves:
  - performance: chance of collision is reduced
  - throughput: many frames can be sent simultaneously
  - security: harder to snoop packages

### Bridges / Switches

Relay on Link Layer.

## Ethernet LANs

- All stations on an Ethernet LAN can communicate with each other at Link Layer
- Multiple LANs are connected using _routers_ which operates at Network Layer

### Spanning Trees

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) eliminates infinite loops when multiple links are made between switches.

- The algorithm selects a root bridge (can also be manually chosen)
- Enables the least cost paths to the root, and disables redundant ones
  - redundant ones can be enabled later if topology changes

## Virtual LANs (VLANs)

Logical LANs.

- Different VLANs are _coloured_ for identification
- **IEEE 802.1Q** defines _colour_ in a backward compatible way
  - Ethernet type = `0x8100` (VLAN protocol)
  - Tag follows
  - Others follows
- Hubs may break the boundaries of VLAN

## Wireless LANs (WLANs)

IEEE 802.11:

- Infrastructure mode
- Ad-hoc mode

Frame format: refer to the slides.

- Addresses: up to 4
  - destination
  - source
  - receiver
  - transmitter

MAC, RTS/CTS, QoS, Reliability, Power Management: refer to the slides.
