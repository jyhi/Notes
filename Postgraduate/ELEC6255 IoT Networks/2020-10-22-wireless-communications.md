# Wireless Communications - The Physical Layer

## A Digital Radio Communications System

- Data
- Source Encoder
  - removes some data (for compression)
  - _ADC_
- Channel Encoder
  - adds some data (for correction)
- Modulator
  - maps bits to symbols
  - e.g. _GPSK, QAM, MSK_
- Frequency Translation
  - _900MHz, 2GHz, ..._
- Amplifier
  - adds power (_10W, 100W, ..._)
- **Wireless Channel**
- Low-noice Amplifier
- Frequency Translation
- Demodulator
- Channel Decoder
  - correct
- Source Decoder
  - decompress
  - _DAC_
- Data

## Signals

- Digital computations are done in discrete time
  - **sampling** allows modern digital electronics to process, transmit, store and retrieve continuous-time signals
