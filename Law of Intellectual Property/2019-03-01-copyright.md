# Copyright

> **Copyright is automatic.**

Copyright is an _intangible_ right which has a **separate subsistence** from the subject matter itself. (see: _Re Dickens, "The Life of Christ" case_)

A subject matter can be protected with

- Must be **"work" (not (new) ideas)**
- Must be in the following **9** categories: <!-- ??? -->
  - Sound recordings
  - Films
  - Broadcasts
  - Cable programmes
  - Typographical arrangements of published editions
- Must be **original** if it is:
  - Literacy work
    - compilation of data (e.g. tables, figures)
    - company program
    - _prepatory design material_ for a computer program
      - literacy work includes computer program, but there is no definition of computer program
    - books (poems, essays, ...)
    - unpublished manuscript
    - newspaper article
    - telephone directories
    - advertising catalogue
  - Dramatic work
  - Musical work
  - Artistic work

**Original != Unique**: originality is more concerned with the manner in which the work was created and originated from the author or creator, with the following involved:

- **skill**
- **judgement**
- **labor**

Owner of copyright has the **exclusive right** to do the following:

- **Reproduce** the work in material form
- **Publish** the work
- **Communicate** the work to public
- Make **adoption** of the work
- **Exploiting** the work in commercial ways

## Copyright Protection

Copyright protects **expression of ideas**, _not ideas per se_.

- See: _Walter v. Lane case_
  - written expressions were protected, not ideas or spoken words
- **Negative right** preventing others making copies of work of an author
- **Partial monopoly** (a number of **exceptions** are made)

In a single piece of work, **different parts can be owned by different people** (e.g. movies, including sound, film, theme song, ...)
