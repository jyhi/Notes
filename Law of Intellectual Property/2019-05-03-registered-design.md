# Registered Design

Registered design protects **novel design applied to goods**: _purely_ **decorative and non-functional** aspects of a product:

- Aesthetics
- Look
- Shape

The design may consist of:

- 3D features, e.g. shape
- 2D features, e.g. patterns, lines, colors

## Design

S.2(1): _design_ means feature of:

- 3D
  - Shape
  - Configuration
  - _Elster Metering Ltd v Billions Ltd_: _shape and configuration both signified something solid, in 3 dimensions_
- 2D
  - Pattern
  - Ornament(decoration)
    - _"Beauty is in eyes of the beholder"_

The **aesthetic value** is "only judged by eye".

## Difference From Patent and Copyright

Registered Design Ordinance, S.2(1):

- To protect novel design devised to be applied to (to govern the shape and construction of) particular articles to be manufactured and marketed commercially.
- Not to protect principles of operation or invention (purpose of patent).
- Not to prevent copying of the direct product of original artistic effort in producing a drawing (purpose of copyright).
- Design's primary concern is what the finished article to look like and not with what it does and the monopoly given to prevent the manufacture and sale of articles of a design not substantially different from the registered design.

## Exclusion

- Methods
- Features, shapes that
  - are dictated (required) _solely_ by the function
  - are dependent on another article...
- Artworks (_copyright_)
  - Sklupture
  - Wall plague
  - Any printed materials

## Registrability

S.2(1):

- new design
- design for article(s)

S.5(2): **New** means:

- not the same as a prior filing
- not the same as a prior registration

S.6(1): If the design is not material (appearence is not cared by people), it is **not** registrable.

## Unregistered Design

- Unregistered design is still protected by the law, except that the owner must prove the existence.
- For registered design, the proprietor **owns monopoly**.

## _Elster Metering Ltd v Billions Ltd_

- Registered design must have **appeal to eyes**
  - If the design is dictated solely by designs and **is not visible from outside**, the design cannot be registered
- **Novelty: slight variations from articles already manufactured are not registrable**

## Applied to Article

**Article**: any article of manufacture, including any part of an article that is **made and sold separately**.

See: _Ford Motor Co Ltd_: dependent components in a car cannot be registered as registered designs.

## Dictated by Function

See: _Interlego v. Tyco Industries_

- Lego bricks **are dictated by function and lack novelty**
