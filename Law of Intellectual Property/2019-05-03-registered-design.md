# Registered Design

Registered design protects **novel design applied to goods**: _purely_ **decorative and non-functional** aspects of a product:

- Aesthetics
- Look
- Shape

The design may consist of:

- 3D features, e.g. shape
- 2D features, e.g. patterns, lines, colors

## Design

S.2(1): _design_ means feature of:

- Shape
- Configuration
- Pattern
- Ornament(decoration)
  - _"Beauty is in eyes of the beholder"_

## Difference From Patent and Copyright

Registered Design Ordinance, S.2(1):

- To protect novel design devised to be applied to (to govern the shape and construction of) particular articles to be manufactured and marketed commercially.
- Not to protect principles of operation or invention (purpose of patent).
- Not to prevent copying of the direct product of original artistic effort in producing a drawing (purpose of copyright).
- Design's primary concern is what the finished article to look like and not with what it does and the monopoly given to prevent the manufacture and sale of articles of a design not substantially different from the registered design.
