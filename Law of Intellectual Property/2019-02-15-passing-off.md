# Passing Off

Passing off (仿冒) is a **claim in tort(侵权, _civil wrong_)** at common law.

> A passing off action is a remedy(措施) for the invasion of a right of property _not in the mark (trademark), name (trade name) or get-up (shape, design, ...) improperly used_, but in the **business or goodwill(信誉)** likely to be **injured** by the **misrepresentation** made by **passing off one person's goods as the goods of another**.
>
> Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart form the business to which it is attached.
>
> -- Lord Diplock in Star Industrial v. Yap Kwee Kor

Passing off:

- Enables a trader to **protect its goodwill (reputation)** on businesses
  - _Only when goodwill exists, there can exist passing off_
- May apply to situations where **trademark protection (statutory intervention, 法定) does not apply**
  - May also be used together with trademark:
    - If (TM) exists, the owner of the registered trademark may sue also in infringement of trademark
- May also be used to protect books and publications which cannot be protected through copyright

## Tort

Types of tort:

1. Negligence(疏忽)
2. Intentional
  - Defamation(诽谤) / Discrimination

## Characteristics For A Passing Off To Be Valid

1. **Misrepresentation**
2. Made by a trader **in the course of their trade**
3. To the trader's prospective customers (潜在顾客) or the ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by trader
4. Is **calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader** (in the sense that it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence)
5. **Causes actual damage to a business or goodwill** of the trader by whom the action is brought or will probably do so

The above can also be summarized as the **classic trinity**:

1. The **goodwill** of the plaintiff(原告)
2. **Misrepresentation** by defendent(被告)
3. The **likelihood of damages**

## Goodwill

> It is a thing very difficult to describe, very difficult to define. It is the **benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business**. It is the **attractive force which brings the custom**. It is the one thing which distinguishes an old established business from a new business at its first start. The goodwill of a business must emanate(表现) from a particular centre or source. However widely extended or diffused(扩散) its influence may be, goodwill is worth nothing unless it has **power of attraction sufficient to bring customers home** to the source from which it emanates.
>
> -- Lord Macnaughten, _The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd_

Goodwill means that the goods have **particular identifying features or specifics** that will enable members of the general public or a specific section of the general public to **associate with those particular goods or services.**

In a passing off action, a plaintiff has to **prove**:

- The existence of a business in which **there is goodwill or reputation**
- That **goodwill or reputation resides** in the exclusive association of the distinctive name, mark, or other indicia(标识) relied on by the business

For other infringement, like trademark, no proving is needed.

### Badge of Recognition

> Law of passing off is **wide enough** to encompass other **descriptive material**, such as
>
> - slogans
> - visual images
> - ...
>
> which radio, television or newspaper advertising campaigns can lead the market to associate with a plaintiff's product, provided always that such test is whether the product has derived from the advertising a **distinctive** character which the market recognises.
>
> -- Lord Scarman, _Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd v. The Pub Squash Co Ltd_

**Distinctiveness:** unusual, fanciful things (e.g. bottles, cigars, colored capsules), can be in the following categories:

- Product name
  - _See: Bollinger v. Costa Brava Wine Co. Ltd, "Spanish Champagne" case_
- Advertising
- Color
- Packaging
- Shape

## Misrepresentation

Plaintiffs must show that:

1. Defendents are **causing** _at least_ the **likelihood of confusion** among a significant portion of the relevant public. This may be done by:
  - imitating a mark or name,
  - or by supplying goods or services to an order which uses the mark or name.
2. Defendents are **responsible for at least some ultimate confusion** in the mark or name of a product earmarked for sale or distribution.
  - When the goods or services offered by both plaintiffs and defendents are the same or are very similar, plaintiffs will _almost always_ suffer damage from passing off.

It is not enough to show that there has been confusion. Before it is actionable, the **confusion must be proved to be caused by a misrepresentation** by the defendent that his goods or services are those of the plaintiff.
