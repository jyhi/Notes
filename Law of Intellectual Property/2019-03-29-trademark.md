# Trademark

Trademark is any **sign** capable of:

- **distinguishing** goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings
- being represented **graphically**

Fundamental requirements of a trademark:

- **distinctiveness**
- **graphic** representation

## Registrability

To be registrable, a trademark must be:

- distinctive
- capable of graphic representation
- **not descriptive**
- not excluded from the Trademark Ordinance

## Refusal of Registration

There are 2 grounds for **refusing** a registration of a mark:

- Absolute grounds
- Relative grounds

### Absolute Grounds

S.11(1):

- signs which do not satisfy requirements of _definition (see above)_
- trademarks which are **devoid of any distinctive character**
  - _AD 2000_
- trademarks which consist exclusively of signs which may serve, in trade or business, to designate the **kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, time of production** of goods or rendering of services, or other characteristics of goods and services
- trademarks which consist exclusively of signs which have become **customary (popular) in the current language** or in the honest and established practices of the trade

S.11(3): A sign shall not be registered as a trademark in relation to goods if it consists exclusively of:

- the shape that **results from the nature** of the goods themselves
- the shape of goods that is **necessary to obtain a technical result**
- the shape that **gives substantial value** to the goods

S.11(4): a trademark shall not be registered if it is:

- **contrary to** accepted principles of **morality**
- likely to **deceive the public**

S.11(5): a trademark shall not be registered if:

- its use is prohibited in Hong Kong under or by virtue of any law
- the application for registration is made in **bad faith**

S.11(6): a trademark shall not be registered if it consists of or contains the **national or regional flags, emblems or their designs**

### Relative Grounds

Under the following circumstances, the mark cannot be registered:

| Mark      | Good / Service |
| --------- | -------------- |
| identical | identical      |
| identical | similar        |
| similar   | identical      |
| similar   | similar        |

S.12(1): A trademark should not be registered if:

- the trademark is **identical** to an earlier work
- the goods or services for which the application for registration is made are **identical** to those for which earlier mark is protected

S.12(2): A trademark shall not be registered if:

- _S.12(1)_
- the use of the trademark in relation to those goods or services is likely to **cause confusion** on the part of the public

S.12(3): A trademark shall not be registered if:

- _S.12(2)_

In determining whether 2 marks are similar, the following factors are relevant:

- how the words **look and sound**
- the goods to which the marks were applied
- the **nature and kind of customer**
- the **surrounding circumstances**
- what would be likely to happen if both marks were used

### Exceptions

- **saving provision** (S.11(2)): a trademark can _still_ be registered if it has, before the date of application for registration, in fact **acquired a distinctive character**, even though it fails to satisfy the requirements of _absolute grounds_

## Specification of Goods and Services

- For every application to register a trademark there must be a specification of the goods or services intended to be covered by the registration
- It is this specification that delimits the registrant's rights
- It is usually advisable to make the specification as wide as possible

## Types of Representation

- Word mark
- Letter / numeral combinations (real or **invented**)
- Logo marks and business names
- Designs
- Designs of vehicles
- Shapes
- Colors
- Composite mark (word mark integrated with a device, logo, or other decorative element)
- What whose purpose is to make word mark more distinctive
- Prince Sovereign and Device trademark
