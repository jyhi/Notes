# Lecture 11: Graph Theory

## Definition

        G = (V, E)

- `V` (vertices / endpoints) cannot be empty, but `E` (edges) can
- A **simplegraph** is a graph where
  - each edge connects to **two different vertices**
  - **no** two edges connect to the **same pair of vertices**
- A **multigraph** is a graph where
  - multiple (`m`) edges **may** connect to the same pair (`(u, v)`)of vertices
  - `(u, v)` has **multiplicity** `m`
- A **loop** is an edge connecting to the vertex itself

Graphs containing _loop_ or is a _multigraph_ are **pseudo-graphs**.

## Degree

- Only in undirected graph
- **number of edges connected**
  - **a loop counts twice**
- Denoted by `deg(v)`

## In-Degree and Out-Degree

- Only in directed graph
- **Edges end at the vertex** and **edges start at the vertex**
- Denoted by `deg^-(v)` / `deg^+(v)`

## Complete Graphs

- Simple graph
- Every pair of vertices are connected

## Cycles

环

## Wheels

轴

## Cubes

- Simple graph of `2^n` vertices
- Each vertex represents a bit string of length `n`
- Two vertices are connected _iff_ they **differ by one bit**

## Graph Isomorphism

Simple graphs `G1 = (V1, E1)` and `G2 = (V2, E2)` are **isomorphic (同构)** if:

1. `f: V1 -> V2` is **bijective**
2. `a, b ∈ G1` are adjacent (connected) **if and only if** `f(a), f(b) ∈ G2` are adjacent

To check if two graphs are isomorphic, we check:

- First round elimination
- Graph invariants

## Graph Connectivity

### Path

A sequence of vertex.

### Circuit

A path that **begins and ends at the same vertex**

### Simple Graph or Circuit

A simple graph or circuit **does not pass through the same edge twice**.

### Graph Connectness

A directed graph is:

- **Strongly connected** if there is a path from any `a` to `b`
- **Weakly connected** if, after the directions are removed, the graph is still connected

## Euler...

- An **euler path** is a _simple graph_ containing **every edge** of `G`
- An **euler circuit** in `G` is a _simple graph_ containing **every edge** of `G`

**Theorem.** A connected multi-graph has an Euler circuit **_iff_ each vertex has _even_ number of degree**.

**Theorem.** A connected multi-graph has an Euler path **_iff_ it has _exactly 2 vertices_ of _odd_ degree**.
