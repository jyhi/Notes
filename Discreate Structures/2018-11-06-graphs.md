# Lecture 11: Graph Theory

## Definition

        G = (V, E)

- `V` (vertices / endpoints) cannot be empty, but `E` (edges) can
- A **simplegraph** is a graph where
  - each edge connects to **two different vertices**
  - **no** two edges connect to the **same pair of vertices**
- A **multigraph** is a graph where
  - multiple (`m`) edges **may** connect to the same pair (`(u, v)`)of vertices
  - `(u, v)` has **multiplicity** `m`
- A **loop** is an edge connecting to the vertex itself

Graphs containing _loop_ or is a _multigraph_ are **pseudo-graphs**.

## Degree

- Only in undirected graph
- **number of edges connected**
  - **a loop counts twice**
- Denoted by `deg(v)`

## In-Degree and Out-Degree

- Only in directed graph
- **Edges end at the vertex** and **edges start at the vertex**
- Denoted by `deg^-(v)` / `deg^+(v)`

## Complete Graphs

- Simple graph
- Every pair of vertices are connected

## Cycles

环

## Wheels

轴

## Cubes

- Simple graph of `2^n` vertices
- Each vertex represents a bit string of length `n`
- Two vertices are connected _iff_ they **differ by one bit**
