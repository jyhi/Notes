# Speaking of Statistics 2017-02-10 Introduction

## Why study statistics?

- Data are **everywhere**.
- Statistical techniques are used to make many decisions that affect our lives.
- No matter what your career, you will **make professional decisions** that involve data.

## What is statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of **collecting, organizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting data** to assist in making more effective decisions.

## 1.1 Data

- Data: facts and figures from which conclusions can be drawn
- Data set: the data that are collected for a particular study
- Elements: may be people, objects, events, or other entries
- Variable: any characteristic of an element
  - **Quantitative**（定量）
    - **Nominative**（无序分类）or **Nominal**（名义的）
      - _e.g. Identifier or Name_
    - **Ordinal**（顺序）
      - _e.g. Ranks_
  - **Qualitative**（定性）(**Categorical**)

## 1.2 Data Sources

- **Existing sources**: data **already gathered** by public or private sources
  - _e.g. Internet, Library, Private data sources_
- **Experimental and obervational studies**: data we **collect ourselves** for a specific purpose

## 1.3 Populations and Samples（总体与样本）

- **Population**: The set of **all** elements about which we wish to draw conclusions (people, objects or events)
- **Sample**: A **subset** of the elements of a population

To collect data:

- **Census（普查）**: An examination of the **entire population** of measurements
  - Usually expensive and time-consuming, even impossible
- **Sample**

## Types of Statistics

- **Descriptive statistics（描述统计）**: The science of **describing the important aspects** of a set of measurements
  - Collect data, e.g. Survey
  - Present Data, e.g. Tables and graphs
  - Characterize data, e.g. Sample mean = ![Sample Mean](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sum{\frac{X_i}{n}})
- **Statistical Inference（统计推断）**: The science of using a sample of measurements to make **generalizations（归纳）** about the important aspects of a population of measurements.
  - Estimation
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Analysis of relationship
  - Forecasting

## 1.4 Three Case Studies That Illustrate Sampling and Statistical Inference

(Cases are omitted)

Terms:

- **Random sample**: Each population element has the same chance of being selected as every other element
  - For unlimited population: **Approximately random sample**

Types of population:

- **Finite population**
- **Infinite population**
