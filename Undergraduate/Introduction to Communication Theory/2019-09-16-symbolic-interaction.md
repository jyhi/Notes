# Symbolic Interaction Theory

Symbolic Interaction is about:

- people talking to each other
- communication through _symbols_

## Core Principles

1. **Meaning**: The construction of social reality
    - _human act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things_
2. **Language**: The source of meaning
    - _as human beings, we have the ability to name things_
3. **Thought**: The process of taking the role of the other
    - _an individual's interpretation of symbols is modified by his or her own thought processes_
4. **Self**: Reflections in a looking glass
    - an **ongoing process** of combining **subjective "I"** and **objective "me"**
5. **Community**: The socializing effect of other's expectations
    - the **generalised other**: the general expectation and attitudes of the social group

### Language

3 Components of a symbol's meaning:

1. **Sign (符号)**
2. **Signifier (符征)**
    - the object the sign was borrowed on
3. **Signified (符旨)**
    - the meaning

### Looking-Glass-Self

The looking-glass self comprises 3 main components that are unique to humans (Shaffer 2005):

- we imagine **how we appear** to others
- we imagine **their judgment** of our appearance
- we feel hurt or pride **based on these self-feelings**
