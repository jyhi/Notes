# Social Penetration Theory

**社会渗透理论**: A _process_ of relationship

## Intimacy

- ... **physical, intellectual, emotional, etc.** (Altman & Taylor, 1973)
  - _people's relationships vary tremendously in their social penetration_

## Self-Disclosure

- Voluntary sharing of personal history, preferences, ...
- Transparency
- Choices about disclosure can alter the course of a relationship

### Breadth of Penetration

**Range of areas** in individual's life over which disclosure takes place.

- describes casual relationship

### Depth of Penetration

**Degree of disclosure** in a specific area of an individual's life.

- determines degree of intimacy

#### Observations on Depth of Penetration

- **Peripheral items exchanged more frequently** and sooner than private information
- Penetration is **rapid at start but slows quickly** as the tightly wrapped inner layers are reached
- Self-disclosure is reciprocal, especially in early stages of relationship development
  - Law of reciprocity – paced and orderly process in which openness in one person leads to openness in the other
- _Depenetration_ is a gradual process of layer-by-layer withdrawal

## Standards of Comparison to Evaluate Interpersonal Outcomes

1. **Comparison Level (CL)**: gauging **relational satisfaction**
2. **Comparison Level of Alternatives (CL_{alt})**: gauging **relational stability**

## Social Penetration Theory vs. Self-Disclosure

> Self-disclosure may be the train, but the final destination is a deepening relationship.
>
> (Altman and Taylor)

## Remark

- Interpersonal closeness proceeds in a gradual and orderly fashion **from superficial to intimate levels of exchange**, motivated by current and projected future outcome.
- Lasting **intimacy requires continual and mutual vulnerability** through breadth and depth of self-disclosure.

## Critiques

- Social penetration established a familiar explanation of how closeness develops
- _Petronio_ thinks it's simplistic to equate self-disclosure with relational closeness
- _Depenatration_: gradual withdrawal?
