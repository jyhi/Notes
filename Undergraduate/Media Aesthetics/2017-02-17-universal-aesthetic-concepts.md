### Law of Pr√§gnanz (Good Figure, Law of Simplicity)

_"People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the **simplest form(s)** possible."_

We prefer things that are simple, clear and ordered.

### Closure

_"When seeing a complex arrangement of elements, we tend to look for a **single, recognizable pattern**."_

### Symmetry and Order

_"People tend to perceive objects as **symmetrical shapes** that form around their center."_

### Figure / Ground

_"Elements are perceived as **either figure** (the element in focus) **or ground** (the background on which the figure rests)."_

### Uniform Connectedness

_"Elements that **are visually connected are perceived as more related** than elements with no connection."_

### Continuation

_"Elements **arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related** than elements not on the line or curve."_

### Past Experiences

_"Elements tend to be perceived according to an observer's **past experience**."_

### Focal Points

_"Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer's attention."_

### Proximity

_"Objects that are closer together are perceived as more related than objects that are further apart."_
