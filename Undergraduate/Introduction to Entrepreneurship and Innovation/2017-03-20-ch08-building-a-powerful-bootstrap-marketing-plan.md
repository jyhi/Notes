# Chapter 8: Building a Powerful Bootstrap Marketing Plan

"Marketing for small companies."

**Competitive Edge（竞争优势）**:
  when a company does better than other companies in the marketplace.

## Building a Bootstrap Marketing Plan

- Marketing:
  - The process of creating and delivering desired goods and services to customers.
  - Involves all of the activities associated with **winning and retaining loyal customers**.
- A _solid business plan_ needs to contain both a **financial plan and a marketing plan**.
- **Bootstrap marketing strategies**:
  - **Unconventional, low-cost, and creative**, allowing a small company to realize a greater return from its marketing investment than do larger rivals.
  - _Do not require large amounts of money_ to be effective – just creativity.

### Three Objectives

1. [**Pinpoint the specific target markets**](#pinpointing-the-target-market) the company will serve.
2. **Determine customer needs** and wants through market research.
3. **Analyze a firm’s competitive advantages and create a marketing strategy** to communicate its value proposition to the target market.

#### Pinpointing the Target Market

- **Target market**: the specific group of customers at whom the company aims its products or services. **(Customers have similar interest and need.)**
- Marketing strategy must be built on a _clear definition_ of a company’s target customers. Example: _BlackRapid_
- Target customer must _permeate（渗透）_ the entire business – merchandise sold, background music, layout, décor(decoration), and other features.
- Without a clear image of its target market, a small company tries to reach almost everyone and ends up appealing to few.

## Market Research

- Determining customer needs:
  - **Demographics（“人口统计”）**: the study of important population characteristics, such as age, income, race, and education.
  - **Market research**: the vehicle for gathering the information that serves as the foundation for the marketing plan.
    - **Never assume that a market exists for your company’s product or service**; _prove it!_
  - Market research does _not_ have to be time consuming, complex, or expensive to be useful.
    - _Online surveys, social media, etc._

### How to Conduct Market Research

- Define the objective.
- Collect the data.
  - Individualized (one-to-one) marketing
    - Primary research（一手调研）
    - Secondary research（二手调研）
  - Data mining
