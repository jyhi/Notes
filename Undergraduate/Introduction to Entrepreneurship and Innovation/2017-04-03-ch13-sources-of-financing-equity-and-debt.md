# Chapter 13 Sources of Financing: Equity and Debt

## Raising Capital

- Many entrepreneurs are caught in a **"credit crunch"**. (or **dedit squeeze** - lack of funds to loan)
- Financing needs in the $100,000 to $3 million range may be the most challenging to fill.

## The "Secrets" to Successful Financing

- Choosing the **right sources of capital** can be _as important as choosing_ the **right form of ownership** or the **right location**.
- The money is out there; the key is knowing where to look.
- Raising money takes time and effort.  
- **Creativity counts.** Entrepreneurs have to be as creative in their searches for capital as they are in developing their business ideas.
- **The Internet** puts at entrepreneur’s fingertips _vast resources_ of information that can lead to financing.
  - _Crowdfunding_
- Put social media to work to locate potential investors.
- **Be thoroughly prepared** before approaching lenders and investors.  
- Entrepreneurs cannot overestimate the importance of making sure that the **"chemistry"** among themselves, their companies, and their funding sources is a good one.  
- **Plan an exit strategy.**
- When capital gets tight remember to bootstrap.

## Financing a Business

- **Layered financing**: Piecing together capital from multiple sources.
- **Capital**: Any form of wealth employed to produce more wealth.
  - Two types:
    - [**Equity**](#equity-capital-股本资本)
    - [**Debt**](#debt-capital-债务资本)

### Equity Capital（股本资本）

- Represents the **personal investment** of the owner(s) in the business.
- Called **risk capital** because investors assume the risk of losing their money if the business fails.
- _Does not have to be repaid with interest like a loan does._
- But, the entrepreneur must give up some ownership in the company to outside investors.

#### Sources of Equity Capital

- **Personal savings**
  - The first place an entrepreneur should look for money.
    - **Bootstrapping**
  - The most common source of equity capital for starting a business.
  - Outside investors and lenders expect entrepreneurs to put some of their own capital into the business before investing theirs.
- **Friends and family members**
  - _After emptying their own pockets_, entrepreneurs should turn to those most likely to invest in the business: friends and family members.
  - **Be careful!** Inherent dangers **lurk (hidden)** in family/friendly business deals, especially those that **flop**.
- **Crowdfunding**
  - Taps the power of social networking and allows entrepreneurs to post their elevator pitches and proposed investment terms on specialized Web sites and raise money from ordinary people who invest as little as $100.
  - **The returns for investment are tokens** – _discount coupons and free samples_.
  - Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act expands the use of crowd funding.
- **Accelerators**
  - Provide a small amount of seed capital and a wealth of additional support for start-up companies.
  - Offer a structured program that lasts from three months to one year.
  - The most important contribution is the coaching and mentoring received.
  - Examples: Y ~~Contributor~~ Combinator and TechStars
- **Angels**
  - Wealthy individuals **who invest in emerging entrepreneurial companies in exchange for equity (ownership)** stakes.
  - An excellent source of _"patient money" (long term capital)_ for investors needing relatively small amounts of capital typically ranging from $100,000 (sometimes less) to as much as $5 million.
  - Willing to invest in the early stages of a business.
  - **52% of angels' investments lose money**, but 7% produce a return _more than 10 times their original investment_.
  - **Look nearby**: within a _50- to 100-mile radius_.
- **Venture capital companies（风投）**
  - **Private, for-profit companies** that purchase equity positions in **young businesses** that they believe have **high-growth and high-profit potential**.
  - Most venture capitalists seek investments in the $5 million to $25 million range.  
  - Business plans are subjected to an extremely rigorous review - **less than 1% accepted**.
  - Most often, venture capitalists invest in a company _across several stages_:
    - Early stage investments (companies in the early stages of development).
    - Expansion stage investments (companies in the rapid growth phase).
  - Only about _2%_ of venture capital goes to businesses in the _startup or seed phase_.
- **Corporate venture capital（企业风投）**
  - Capital infusions are just one benefit; corporate partners may **share marketing and technical expertise**.  
- **Public stock sale**
  - **IPO: When a company raises capital by selling shares of its stock to the public _for the first time_.**
  - _Few companies with less than $25 million in annual sales make IPOs._

### Debt Capital（债务资本）

- _Must be repaid with interest._
- Is carried as a **liability** (**debit**) on the company’s balance sheet.
- _Can be just as difficult to secure_ as equity financing, even though sources of debt financing are more numerous.
- **Can be expensive**, especially for small companies, because of the risk/return tradeoff.

#### The Nature of Debt Financing

- Borrowed capital allows entrepreneurs to maintain complete ownership of their businesses, but **must be repaid with interest**.
- Small businesses are considered more risky than corporate customers（企业客户）.
