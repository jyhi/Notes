- **Porter's Five Forces Model**: Five forces interact with one another to determine the setting in which companies compete and, hence, the attractiveness of the industry:
  - **Rivalry** among companies in the industry
  - _Bargaining_ power of **suppliers**
  - _Bargaining_ power of **buyers**
  - _Threat_ of **new entrants**
  - _Threat_ of **substitute products or services**
