# Counting: Permutation, Combination and Coefficient

aka **Combinatorics**, the study of arrangements of objects.

## The Pigeonhole Principle (抽屉原理)

1. If `k` is a positive integer and `k + 1` or more objects are placed into `k` boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects
2. If `n` objects are placed into `k` boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least `ceil(n / k)` objects.

## Permutation (排列数)

- A **permutation** of a set of distinct objects is:
  - an **ordered arrangement** of the objects
- An **r-permutation** is:
  - an ordered arrangement of `r` element of a set of objects
  - **denoted as `P(n, r)`**
- **Theorem 1:** If `n` is a positive number and `r` is an integer with `1 <= r <= n`, then `P(n, r) = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... (n - r + 1)`
2. **Corollary 1:** If `n` and `r` are integers with `1 <= r <= n`, then `P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!`

## Combination (组合数)

- An **r-combination** of elements of a set of `n` elements is an **unordered selection** of `r` elements from the set
- **Theorem 2**: The number of r-combination of a set with `n` elements with `0 <= r <= n`, is `C(n, r) = n! / (r! (n - r)!)`
- **Corollary 2**: If `n` and `r` are integers with `0 <= r <= n`, then `C(n, r) = C(n, n - r)`
