# Lecture 13: Trees

A tree is **a connected, undirected, simple graph** that contains **no circuit**.

## Rooted Trees

A tree in which one node is a root.

- A vertex of a tree is called a **leaf**
- A vertex having children is called **internal vertex**

## M-Ary Trees

(多叉树)

- When `m = 2`, the tree is called **binary tree (二叉树)**
- The tree is **full** if every internal vertex has exactly `m` children

## Balanced Tree

A balanced tree if **all levels are at levels `h` or `h - 1`**.

## Tree Applications

### Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a tree that, for each vertex `v`:

- `v`'s value is **greater than all values in its left subtree**
- `v`'s value is **less than all values in its right subtree**

### Tree Traversal

- Pre-order
- In-order
- Post-order

### Expression Trees

- Prefix form: Pre-order traversal
- Infix form: In-order traversal
- Postfix form: Post-order traversal

### Spanning Tree

- Remove edges until there are no cycles
