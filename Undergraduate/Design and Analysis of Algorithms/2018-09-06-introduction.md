# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Definitions

- **Computational Problem**: a specification of the desired input-output relationship.
- **Algorithm**:  well defined computational procedure that transforms inputs into outputs, achieving the desired input-output relationship.
- **Instance**: **all the inputs** needed to compute a solution to the problem.
- **Algorithm Correctness**: A correct algorithm **halts** with the correct output for every input instance. We can then say that the algorithm solves the problem
  - An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.
