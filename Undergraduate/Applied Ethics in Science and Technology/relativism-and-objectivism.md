# Ethical Theories: Relativism & Objectivism

## Ethical Relativism

- There is no universally accepted ethical standard
  - Different cultures have different ethical standards
  - There is no objective standard of right or wrong (unlike natural sciences)
  - "Personal ethical relativism"
  - "Social ethical relativism"
- **Reasons for ethical relativism**
  - **Diversity of moral views**
  - **Moral uncertainty**
  - **Situation differences**
- Morality is a set of believe individual or society have, nothing more
  - Any problem with this theory?

### Arguments against ethical relativism

- Are there really differences in moral views?
  - Disagreement on a moral issue does _not_ mean taht a "correct" moral stand about the issue does not exist
- Moral uncertainty or moral skepticism means that moral decision is difficult but not impossible
  - Moral unceratinty leads to _inaction_. (Perhaps, time will tell.)
- Even under different situations there should be a "correct" moral practice
  - General values: justice, compassion, happiness... _does not change under any circumstances_.
- Ethical relaticism: intellectual laziness, lack of moral courage?

## Objectivism

- The truth or falsity of _typical_ moral judgements does _not_ depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons.
- **Moral Realism**: Objective good is a _reality_ independent of who views it, as in natural science.
- **Moral pluralism**: There may be _more than one_ set of qually valid moral principles, and sometimes one as to chose between them.
