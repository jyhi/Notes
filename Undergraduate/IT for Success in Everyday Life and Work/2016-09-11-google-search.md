*The Essential Practice of Information Technology* Chapter 2: Google Search

## Basic Practice

### Google Operators

- Quote marks (**""**): locate an **entire string**
- Plus (**+**): search for **essential words**
    - e.g. *+"Chris Evans" tutorial* will return all results containing "Chris Evans" but not necessarily those pertaining to a tutorial
- Minus (**-**): **exclude unwanted things**
    - e.g. *bass-music* will return all results with "bass" **and not "music"**
    - e.g. *-filetype:pdf* will NOT list any results with PDF file type
- Tilde (**~**): search for **similar words**
    - e.g. *~university admission essay* will search admission essay for universities, colleges, and so on
- Wildcard (__*__): matches **any words**
    - e.g. _Obama signed the * bill_ will search for any bill that Obama signed
- Site operator (**site:**): search only on a specific website
- Related operator (**related:**): search pages related to the pattern
    - e.g. *related:uic.edu.hk* will search pages related to the UIC homepage, and the homepage of [HKBU](http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/eng/main/index.jsp) and [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/) are both deemed relevant to the search.
- Filetype operator (**filetype:**): do a search for a specific file type
- Intitle operator (**intitle:**): restricts the results to documents containing that word in the title.
    - e.g. *intitle:UIC ceremony* will return documents that mention the word "UIC" in their **title**, and mention the word "ceremony" **anywhere** in the document.

### Google Utilities

- Dictionary: **define:**
- Weather reporter: **weather:**
- Calculator: Directly search for a formula
- Unit convertor: **UNIT in UNIT** (Convert the former to the latter)

### Google Image

Google image search can be conducted in two ways:

1. Search: Given keywords, Google finds related images;
2. Reverse search: Given images, Google finds related information about it.

**NOTE: Google Image reverse search does not always produce helpful results especially when your image is original.** (WHAAT?)

## Advanced Practice: Google Scholar

Google Scholar can:

- **Find recent papers**
    - Click "Since Year" to show only recently published papers, **sorted by relevance**
    - Click "Sort by date" to show just the new articles, **sorted by date**
    - Click the envelope icon to have new results periodically delivered by Email
- **Access the article**
    - Click a link labeled "PDF" or "HTML" to the right of the search result
    - Click "All versions" under the search result and check out the alternative sources
    - Click "Related articles" or "Cited by" under the search result to explore similar articles
    - **The full text is not always freely available.**

A few sourtcuts to search Google Scholar presicely:

- If you know the general subject of an author's paper, just type in their last name with the subject
    - e.g. *Ehrenreich poverty*
- If you are looking for a specific author's works, type in the full name (or first name initial with last name) **in quotes**.
    - e.g. *"Barbara Ehrenreich"* or *"B Ehrenreich"*
- Use the author operator (**author:**) to get an author's works. For example, *author:Ehrenreich*
