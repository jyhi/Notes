# What Is Software Engineering?

## What Is Software

- Software is
  - Instructions
  - Data structures
  - Documents

Software is computer programs and associated documentation. (**Software = Programs + Documentation**)

- Software has no mass (?)
- Software does not "wear out", but it does "deteriorate"(衰退)

Types of software:

- Generic software
  - System software
  - ...
- Customized software
  - Real-time software
  - Business software
  - Embedded software
  - ...

### Software Development History

(See also: _50 Years of Software Engineering_)

1. House software
  - Hardware was expensive, human resources are cheap
2. Product software
3. Distributed software
4. Network software
  - Hardware becomes cheap, network makes software distribution and reuse easier

## What Is Engineering

The **analysis, design, constructions, verifications, and management** of technical entities

## Software Engineering

Software Engineering is

- Sommerville:
  - an engineering **discipline** which is concerned with all aspects of software production
- IEEE 93':
  1. the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, **the application of engineering to software**.
  2. the study of approaches as in 1.

        Software engineering -- Produces --> Software

### Purpose of Software Engineering

- Obtain high **quality** software
- Reduce development **cost**
- Meet the **deadline** of project

### Difference Between SE and CS

- Computer Science
  - Theories
  - Fundamentals
- Software Engineering
  - Practical problems

### SE Practices

- Requirement **analysis**
- Software **design**
- Software **programming**
- Software **verification** and **validation**
- Software **maintenance**
