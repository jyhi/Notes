# Lecture 4: System Models

**System models** are used to describe:

- **Environment**
  - context model, use case diagram, ...
- **Behavior flow**
  - state machine model, dataflow model, ...
- **Structure**
  - data models, object models, ...

... of a system.

## Context Models (上下文模型)

- Deciding **boundaries** of enviroment of a system
  - what are _not included in_ but _related with_ the system

## User Case Diagrams

- Describing a system's functionalities **from the point of view of users (externally visible)**
  - **actors**: **role** of the user
  - **use cases** (interactors): **tasks** the system can perform
- First step in requirement specification
