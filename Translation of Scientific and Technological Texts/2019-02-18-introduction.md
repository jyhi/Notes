- **"Tone"** during first read

## Purposes for Translation

### The Skopos Theory

- The concept of skopos subsumes the concepts of "aim", "purpose", "function", and "intention" of the target text.
- The prime principle determining any translation process is the purpose (skopus) of the overall translational action.
