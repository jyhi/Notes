# Semiotics of Roland Barthes

> 符号学

Goal of semiotics / semiology:

- to **interpret signs**
- to **decipher cultural meanings of visual signs**

Refer to [Symbolic Interaction](./2019-09-16-symbolic-interaction.md): _Sign_

## Notions

1. A sign does not stand on its own: **it's a part of a system**.
2. Signs are **culturally different**.
3. Signs **transition**.
    - Sign of the first system may become the signifier of the second.
