# Chapter 3: Vector Spaces

...

Let **V** be a set of objects on which addition and scalar multiplication are defined. Then **V** together with operations addition and scalar multiplication is called a **vector space** _if the following axioms hold_:

- For any **x, y ∈ V**, we also have **x + y ∈ V**.
- For any **x ∈ V** and any scalar α we have **αx ∈ V**.

## Linear Combinations of Vectors

We call a__u__ +b__v__ + c__w__ a linear combination of the vectors __u__, __v__, and __w__.
