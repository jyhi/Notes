# Lecture 1: Introduction

## Definition

- "Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." _Arthur Samuel, 1959_
- "Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience `E` with respect to some task `T` and some performance measure `P`, if its performance on `T`, as measured by `P`, improves with experience `E`." _Tom Mitchell, 1998_

## Algorithms

- Supervised（有监督学习）
- Unsupervised（无监督学习）

### Supervised Learning

- Learn from given data ("right answers")
- Derive a function (**hypothesis**)
- Predict a value from parameters (**regression**)
- ... or, do **classification** (output discreate values, 0 or 1)
- **Cost** is the distance between data points and the hypothesis
