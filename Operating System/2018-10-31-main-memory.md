# Chapter 9: Main Memory

## Logical vs. Physical Address Space

- **Logical address**: generated by the CPU, aka **virtual address**
- **Physical address**: seen by the memory unit
- Translation done by **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** in realtime (runtime)

### Memory Management Unit

#### Simple Scheme

- **Relocation register**: the _base register_
- Logical address + relocation register = physical address
