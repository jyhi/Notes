No universally accepted definition:

- "Everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system"
- "The one program in memory at all times on the computer" -> **Kernel**
- Everything else is either:
  - **A system program**
  - **An application program**

## Computer System Organization

- One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common **bus** providing access to shared memory
- Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
